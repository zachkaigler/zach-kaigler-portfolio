      <p>
          Hello friends! My name is Zach Kaigler, and Iâ€™m a Brooklyn based software engineer
          with a passion for beautiful design and years of experience pushing production
          code.
      </p>
      <p>
          I'm currently working with Glen Lake Pioneering to help companies transform their
          ideas into fantastic products, and so at the moment I'm not looking for new opportunites.
          I am, however, always up for talking shop! Please feel free to reach out with any thoughts,
          questions, or Magic: The Gathering deck ideas.
      </p>
