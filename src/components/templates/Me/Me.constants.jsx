      <p>
          Hello friends! My name is Zach Kaigler, and Iâ€™m a Brooklyn based software engineer
          with a passion for beautiful design and clean code.
      </p>
      <p>
          I'm currently working with <a href="https://www.clearmix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="inline-link">ClearMix</a>, 
          developing tools built to help make video production easier
          and more accessible to the masses - and so at the moment I'm not looking
          for new opportunities. I am, however, always open to discussing interesting ideas! 
          Feel free to reach out if you want to talk shop.
      </p>
